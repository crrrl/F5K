		<h1>The Help the Animals Fund</h1>
		<p id="blockindent">The Seattle Animal Shelter takes in approximately 7,000 
		stray and owner-surrendered animals each year. Many of these animals arrive 
		sick and injured from living on the streets; others are seized from abusive 
		or neglectful owners. To provide veterinary care for these sick, injured 
		and abused animals, the Seattle Animal Shelter created the Help the Animals 
		Fund (HTAF) in 1977. </p>
		<br />
		<p id="blockindent">As the Seattle Animal Shelter’s veterinary needs expanded, 
		volunteers started the Furry 5K in 1999 to fundraise and promote awareness 
		for the Help the Animals Fund. All proceeds from the Furry 5K directly support 
		the Help the Animals Fund. Veterinary care needs continue to expand and 
		last year the Help the Animals Fund paid for over $104,000 worth of veterinary 
		bills. </p>

			<h2>Help the Animals Fund Alumni</h2>
			<h3>Oscar and Jack</h3>
			<p id="blockindent2">
			<img id="img_rt" alt="Oscar and Jack" src="img/alumni/OscarandJack.png" />Oscar 
			and Jack came to the shelter as just 8 day old baby bunnies. Shelter 
			staff had never seen such tiny bunnies. Luckily, two critter foster 
			parents were able to take on the challenge of bottle-feeding and hand-raising 
			these tiny boys.</p>
			<br />
			<p class="blockindent2">The road that lay ahead was tough. Without a 
			mother, these poor boys were highly susceptible to disease in their 
			first weeks. Through the support of the Help the Animals Fund, Jack 
			and Oscar received expert vet care as they grew bigger and stronger. 
			Day-by-day they experienced new things, eventually even becoming confident 
			enough to ride on their foster mom’s shoulders.</p>
			<br />
			<p class="blockindent2">
			<img id="img_lt" alt="Oscar" src="img/alumni/Oscar.png" /> At four months, 
			Jack and Oscar were old enough and healthy enough to be returned to 
			the shelter. They love to snuggle with volunteers and especially enjoy 
			hopping around their enclosure to entertain potential adopters. They 
			are patiently waiting for their forever home, together. </p>
			<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<h3>Wiggles</h3>
			<p id="blockindent2">
			<img id="img_rt" alt="Wiggles" src="img/alumni/Wiggles.png" />Wiggles 
			is a happy, happy dog. Her favorite activities include washing faces, 
			cuddling and playing with her friends. Unfortunately, Wiggles suffered 
			from a luxating patella, commonly known as a floating knee. This condition 
			caused Wiggles pain and made it difficult to do one of her favorite 
			things – playing with her friends. This condition also would make Wiggles 
			unadoptable to most homes.</p>
			<br />
			<p class="blockindent2">With donations to the Help the Animals Fund, 
			Wiggles was able to get the surgery she needed. She is now spending 
			three months in recovery with her foster family. Her new knee should 
			be ready for its debut just in time for the 2012 Furry 5K. </p>
			<br />
			<h3>Stitch</h3>
			<p id="blockindent2">
			<img id="img_lt" alt="Stitch" src="img/alumni/Stitch2.png" /> In the 
			animal shelter world, 2 A.M calls are rarely good. Stitch was found 
			in a pillowcase, clearly the victim of animal abuse. It was unclear 
			just how bad Stitch’s injuries were, but she needed help immediately. 
			With the financial support of the Help the Animals Fund, shelter staff 
			decided to save Stitch’s life.</p>
			<br />
			<p class="blockindent2">After many hours of surgery to close over 20 
			wounds, Stitch is making a full recovery. Her staples and stitches have 
			been removed, and her hair is growing back. Stitch is a fighter and 
			has shown that she definitely hasn’t used all of her nine lives.</p>
			<br />
			<p class="blockindent2">
			<img id="img_rt" alt="Stitch" src="img/alumni/Stitch1.png" /> Stitch’s 
			foster mom reports that she is a great cat – both curious and sweet 
			with a fighting spirit. Some of Stitch’s wounds may always be visible, 
			but she has learned to trust people again and embrace her new chance. 
			Stitch will soon be running, jumping and playing just like old times.</p>
