			<p id="blockindent2">Q: I don&#39;t have a dog. Can I still participate 
			in the Furry 5K?<br />
			<span class="answer">A: Everybody is welcome to participate in the Furry 
			5K!</span> </p>
			<br />
			<p id="blockindent2">Q: I don&#39;t have a dog. Can I run one of the shelter 
			dogs? <br />
			<span class="answer">A: No. Only SAS Staff and SAS trained volunteers 
			are allowed to handle shelter animals. All SAS volunteers are required 
			to go through a certain amount of training before ever handling any 
			shelter animals.</span> </p>
			<br />
			<p id="blockindent2">Q: I have a puppy that is not quite 6 months old 
			but is very active. We would like to run him/her to the race. Would 
			this be okay? <br />
			<span class="answer">A: Feel free to bring your puppy to the race however 
			you will need to participate in the walk and not the run. This regulation 
			was established with your puppy&#39;s best interest and health in mind.</span>
			</p>
			<br />
			<p id="blockindent2">Q: Will there be shelter dogs at the race? We think 
			it will be great to see all of the dogs that are available for adoption.
			<br />
			<span class="answer">A: Maybe. As much as we want to show off the dogs 
			available for adoption at the race, the race atmosphere might be too 
			stressful for our shelter dogs. We encourage you to stop by the shelter 
			after the race to see dogs available for adoption. The shelter is open 
			that Sunday from 12 to 6 p.m.</span></p>
			<br />
			<p id="blockindent2">Q: I have an animal (other than a dog) that I would 
			like to bring. They get along with our family dogs as well as other 
			dogs in the neighborhood so we don&#39;t think it will be a problem. Would 
			this be okay? <br />
			<span class="answer">A: We discourage bringing animals other than well-behaved, 
			non-aggressive dogs to the Furry 5K. We cannot assume that all dogs 
			at the race will respond well to other animals. <br />
			<b><i>The event does benefit ALL ANIMALS at the Seattle Animal Shelter 
			though!</i></b></span> </p>
			<br />
			<p id="blockindent2">Q: Can I use my in-skates or ride my scooter in 
			the Furry 5K?<br />
			<span class="answer">A: No. This is for the safety of humans and animals.</span>
			</p>
			<br />
			<p id="blockindent2">Q: Are baby strollers allowed in the Furry 5K?<br />
			<span class="answer">A: Yes.</span> </p>
			<br />
			<p id="blockindent2">Q: I have a child, do I need to register them?<br />
			<span class="answer">A: Yes, we ask that you do. This is a fundraiser 
			so we hope that you will think of the registration fee simply as a donation 
			to a good cause.</span></p>
			<br />
			<p id="blockindent2">Q: How do I get to the race?<br />
			<span class="answer">A: From North or South I-5, Go east on I-90. Take 
			Exit 3 Rainier Avenue South. Turn right on Rainier Avenue and go 3.1 
			miles. Turn left on South Orcas street and go 0.9 miles. Continue onto 
			Lake Washington Blvd. S. and go south for 600 feet to Seward Park. Additional 
			directions can be found

			here</a>.</span></p>
			<br />
			<p id="blockindent2">Q: Is there parking in Seward Park?<br />
			<span class="answer">A: No. You will need to park in the surrounding 
			neighborhood. We encourage you carpool and arrive early as parking can 
			be difficult.</span> </p>
