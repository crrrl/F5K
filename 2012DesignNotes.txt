Hi Carl,

I have attached the Web Images in a zip file - there are only 9 new images as we are re-purposing most from last year.
I have tried to note any changes.

Color Story for the site uses the following colors:
There are 2 new colors (light blue and a yellow/green), the orange from last year changed slightly and we are not using the lime green.

$Orange hex:  F7941E (previously was f7931e)
Yellow/Green hex:  E4E517 (new!)
Dark Blue/Grey hex:  3D505A (same color as last year)
White hex: FFFFFF
$Light Blue:  85D5F7 (new!)

23px drop shadow

$Margin top: 73px (new measure)
$Margin bottom: 140px (new measure)
$Remove the following white type below body:  design by whitecanyondesign.com
$All pages image titles, body color are staying the same as last year.
$*If you need me to re-send page title images let me know

$All nav buttons & padding on left sidebar are currently staying the same.
$*I need to double check this as the right sidebar buttons for tweet, fb, register and donate have different on/off colors.

$All body and sidebar text should be the Dark Blue/Grey hex:  3D505A (same as last year)
$Inline text <a> links should be the Light Blue:  85D5F7, text should be <strong></strong> (different color from last year)
$Inline text <a> hover should be the Yellow/Green hex:  E4E517, text should be <strong></strong> (different color from last year)

Are you going to be able to integrate the drop shadow in this year?
Can you use CSS3?
If you need images, I will need to wait until Cindy gets back next week as the way her design file is formatted I can't separate the drop shadow.

If you need anything else or have any questions, feel free to give me a shout at 206-851-1534
Please confirm that you received.

Thank you!
Kari

No problem. I’m actually pretty busy right now and may not be able to start on this for a few days anyway.
